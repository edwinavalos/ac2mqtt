- 2 bytes: header (165, 0)
- 2 bytes: length of command payload
- 2 bytes: sequence number, to be incremented by sender after each command
- 2 bytes: CRC16 of 6 previous bytes
- 1 byte: always 0x00
- 1 byte: command category, including, but not limited to:
    - 1: GET some value
    - 3: SET some value
    - 8: FACTORY RESET
- actual command(s), possibly several, all in the same category:

        - 1 byte: value to get
    - for SET commands:
        - 1 byte: value to set
        - 1 byte: payload length
        - command payload
- optionally, for multi-port controllers:
    - 1 byte: always 0xff
    - 1 byte: port number
- 2 bytes: CRC16 of everything after the previous CRC
